# FFTBalance

FFTBalance is an **experimental** command-line tool for balancing the frequency spectrum of audio files using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). It takes an input audio file and a reference audio file, analyzes their frequency content, and applies a gain adjustment to the input file to match the spectral characteristics of the reference file.

## Prerequisites

To build and run FFTBalance, you need the following libraries installed on your system:

*   **libsndfile**: A C library for reading and writing files containing sampled sound (like WAV, AIFF, FLAC, Ogg/Vorbis).
*   **FFTW3**: The Fastest Fourier Transform in the West, a C subroutine library for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT).
*   **CMake**: A cross-platform free software tool designed to simplify the process of compilation of source code.
*   **A C++ compiler**: (e.g., GCC, Clang)

## Build Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd FFTBalance
    ```

2.  **Create a build directory and navigate into it:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ```

3.  **Run CMake to configure the project:**
    ```bash
    cmake ..
    ```

4.  **Build the project:**
    ```bash
    make
    ```
    This will compile the `fft_balance` executable in the `build` directory.

## Run Instructions

After building, you can run the `fft_balance` executable from the `build` directory.

```bash
./fft_balance <input_audio_file> <reference_audio_file> <output_audio_file>
```

**Example:**

```bash
./fft_balance Input.wav Reference.wav Balanced.wav
```

This command will process `Input.wav` using `Reference.wav` as a spectral guide and save the result to `Balanced.wav`.
